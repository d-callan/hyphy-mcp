This suggests that positive selection is acting on sites in the dataset.\n*   **Model Fit:** In both cases, the unconstrained model (allowing for positive selection) has a higher log likelihood and a lower AIC-c compared to the constrained model, further supporting the presence of positive selection.\n*   **Rate Distributions:** The estimated proportions of sites evolving under different selective pressures (ω values) are nearly identical between the two runs. Both indicate that a small proportion of sites (around 1.2%) are under positive selection (ω > 1), while the majority are under purifying selection (ω < 1).\n\nThe minor differences in the LRT statistic, p-value, and omega values are negligible and likely due to very slight numerical variations in the computation, rather than any significant difference in the underlying analysis or input. It appears these two jobs effectively produced the same results."

      "content": "That's an excellent observation! Given how remarkably similar the results are between the two BUSTED jobs – one with a provided tree and the other with an inferred tree – it strongly suggests that HyPhy's tree inference process produced a phylogenetic tree that is very consistent with the manually provided one, at least in terms of its impact on the BUSTED analysis.\n\nIn this specific case, it appears that HyPhy did a very good job of inferring a tree that led to virtually identical conclusions regarding positive selection. This indicates that for this dataset and analysis, the inferred tree was \"no worse than\" the manually provided one, and effectively just as good for the purpose of detecting pervasive positive selection."
