I use Vega-Lite specifications to generate custom visualizations.\n\nTo create a custom plot, I need you to tell me:\n1.  **What kind of plot you'd like to create:** Describe the plot in detail (e.g., \"a scatter plot of X vs. Y\", \"a bar chart showing the frequency of Z\").\n2.  **Which job ID the data is associated with:** For example, you have a `busted job` with ID `30278635d8616db2c5d4cadec648c015afabf423ad541612dba76dc572dfa7b4`.\n\nOnce I have this information, I can generate a custom visualization for you."
